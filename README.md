                Branch Infomation:
Current State of Master Branch is unstable as I'm changing the whole paradigm or method of how the scripts define and excuted themselves. In it way it's a major rewrite. That's why I posted them early to save my work.

                Scripting Credits:
PlusIce (major revisions), Merciless Mod Team (Original Code), Tally (Demon Mod Scripts) Bell (AWE Scripts)
iNAK' (Medkit and Ammobox Scripts), Bloodlust (Mine Defuse Chance), Filbertish (Mods Menu code snippets)
Number7 (cvardef) Ravir (cvardef), La Truffe (AWE utils scripts)

                  Game Files:
You can find the Game Files on Moddb.com or under Game Files Branch (currently empty)

Latest Stable is Merciless Mod 2 V3.2 which can be found on Moddb.com.
Merciless Mod 2 V3.3 and Merciless Mod 2 v3.4 Public Beta, can run in listen mode but are too buggy for dedicated server mode.
