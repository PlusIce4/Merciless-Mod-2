I'm open to help from other C Programer(s) who want to contribute to this project.

This strictly a voluntary project, not looking to hire people for money. But helping out could help fluff your resume?

Probably leaving client same pretty much, aside from more static models for custom nades, new ammoboxes ect.

Most changes are going to be server side.
